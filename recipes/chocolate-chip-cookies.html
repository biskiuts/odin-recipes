    <h2>How to Make Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
    <p>Chocolate chip cookies are a classic treat loved by many for their delightful combination of soft, chewy texture and rich chocolate flavor. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h3>Chocolate Chip Cookies Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unsalted butter</strong>: Adds richness and flavor, contributing to the cookies' texture. It's usually softened for easier mixing.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Bind the ingredients together and add moisture, helping to create a soft texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla extract</strong>: Adds a rich, sweet flavor that complements the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Granulated sugar</strong>: Sweetens the cookies and helps them spread during baking, resulting in a crisp texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown sugar</strong>: Provides moisture and a deeper, caramel-like flavor due to its molasses content.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda</strong>: A leavening agent that helps the cookies rise and become light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Water</strong>: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: Enhances the flavors of the other ingredients and balances the sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which providing bulk and a chewy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate chips</strong>: The star ingredient, providing bursts of rich chocolate flavor. They can be semi-sweet, dark, or milk chocolate, depending on preference.</li>
        <li><strong>Nuts (optional)</strong>: Adds crunch and a nutty flavor to the cookies.</li>
    </ul>
